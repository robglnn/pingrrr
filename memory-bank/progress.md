# Progress â€“ Pingrrr

## Status Summary (Oct 24, 2025)
- Core messaging foundation in place with SwiftData + Firestore sync, presence, and notification pipeline.
- Profile management and smart message display completed as part of MVP enhancements.
- Remaining MVP tasks focus on chat management, read receipts, media pipeline, and voice messaging.

## Completed
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, and active context.
- Implemented Firebase-integrated profile editing (callable function, storage rules, ProfileService/UI).
- Added WhatsApp-style grouped message presentation with avatar/name logic and profile prefetching.

## In Progress
- Planning and implementation of enhanced messaging features (local chat deletion, read receipts, media, voice).

## Blockers / Risks
- Tight MVP deadline demands efficient sequencing and rigorous regression testing.
- Need to ensure Firebase Storage/Functions deployments stay aligned with feature rollout (media/voice).

## Upcoming Tasks
- Local-only swipe-to-delete conversations.
- Group read receipts UX (overlapping avatars, popover details).
- Media sharing pipeline with caching, camera/library support.
- Voice message recording/playback with auto-cleanup policies.
- Extended testing scenarios covering grouped messaging, profile updates, and offline sync.
