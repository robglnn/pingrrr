# Progress – Pingrrr

## Status Summary (Oct 25, 2025)
- Voice messaging end-to-end functional with Firebase Storage uploads, lazy playback, and auto-delete warning.
- Inline AI actions (translation, cultural hints, slang explanations, tone adjustments) available via long press with contextual insight bubbles.
- Firebase Functions deployed with OpenAI secret + Vercel AI SDK; Vercel project configured with matching env variables.
- Dedicated AI Assistant chat view added to conversations list with context selection, quick actions, and assistant responses.

## Recent Highlights
- Added `AIService`/`AIPreferencesService` plus callable endpoints for translate/detect/hint/tone/slang/smart replies/summarize/assistant.
- Contextual globe toggle hooked into ChatViewModel with caching; long-press menu triggers additional AI helpers and insight cards.
- Deployed updated Firestore rules + secret-managed functions; verified build using `npm run build` and `firebase deploy`.
- Set up Vercel project and stored `OPENAI_API_KEY` for future edge/preview work.

## Status Summary (Oct 24, 2025)
- Core messaging foundation in place with SwiftData + Firestore sync, presence, and notification pipeline.
- Profile management and smart message display completed as part of MVP enhancements.
- Remaining MVP tasks focus on chat management, read receipts, media pipeline, and voice messaging.

## Completed
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, and active context.
- Implemented Firebase-integrated profile editing (callable function, storage rules, ProfileService/UI).
- Added WhatsApp-style grouped message presentation with avatar/name logic and profile prefetching.
- Delivered AI contextual actions (translation, slang explanation, cultural hints, tone adjustment) with inline insight UI.
- Built AI Assistant chat view with quick actions and assistant responses.

## In Progress
- Translation toggle UX polish (globe tap feedback) and assistant history storage.
- Smart replies row + thumbs feedback and proactive suggestion logic.
- Rate-limit UX + metrics instrumentation outlined in plan.

## Blockers / Risks
- Tight MVP deadline demands efficient sequencing and rigorous regression testing.
- Need to ensure Firebase Storage/Functions deployments stay aligned with feature rollout (media/voice + AI).
- Node.js 18 Cloud Functions runtime deprecates Oct 30, 2025—upgrade path to Node 20 required soon.

## Upcoming Tasks
- Implement smart replies surface and feedback loop; add proactive triggers (language switch, typing pause).
- Surface rate-limit messaging (20 requests/day) and aggregate latency/token metrics.
- Clean up translation toggle experience and verify in multi-language chats.
- Extended testing covering AI insight flows, assistant interactions, voice messaging, and offline sync.
